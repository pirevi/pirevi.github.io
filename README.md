## Hi, I am Vivek Revi
A Mechanical Engineer who turned into a Data Scientist. Here are some projects that I had worked on.

# [Machine Learning Elastic Constants of Multi-Component Alloys](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2021.110671)
- This was a project which I converted into a research article, it was done as part of my M.Tech thesis in IIT Bombay.
- The goal was to design surrogate ML model for property prediction of Multi-Component alloys, bypassing the conventional way of property prediction using computationally intensive DFT simulation.
- The trained ML model shows that they are good predictors of elastic constants of materials, and can even generalizes well for materials beyond their training set.
- I also demonstrated the practical utility of the developed model by making high-throughput predictions on all possible compositions that can be combinatorially-enumerated within a five-component Nickel based alloy system.

# [Realtime Prediction for Gender and Emotion (Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV)](https://github.com/pirevi/Realtime-Prediction-Gender-and-Emotion)
- The goal was to create a Convolutional Neural Network based model which will be able to identify the gender and emotion of a person in real time.
- I created two separate models. One which will be trained to classify faces based on gender and the other one which will be able to detect emotion of the face.
- I have used Tensorflow with Keras for our model training and OpenCV for real-time face detection and prediction.
