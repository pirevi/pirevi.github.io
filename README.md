# Hi, I am Vivek Revi.
I am a Mechanical Engineer who turned into a Data Scientist. Here are some cool projects that I had worked on.

# [Machine Learning Elastic Constants of Multi-Component Alloys](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2021.110671)
- This was a project which I converted into a research article, done as part of my M.Tech thesis in IIT Bombay.
- The goal was to design surrogate ML model for property prediction of Multi-Component alloys, bypassing the conventional way of property prediction using computationally intensive DFT simulation.
- The trained ML model shows that they are good predictors of elastic constants of materials, and can even generalizes well for materials beyond their training set.
- I also demonstrate the practical utility of the developed model by making high-throughput predictions on all possible compositions that can be combinatorially-enumerated within a five-component Nickel based alloy system.
